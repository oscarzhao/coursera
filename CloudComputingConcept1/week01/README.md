1. Massive Scale
2. On-demand access: Pay-as-you-go, no upfront commitment
3. Data-intensive nature: What was MBs has now become TBs, PBs, and XBs
4. New Cloud Programming Paradigms: MapReduce/Hadoop, NoSQL/Cassandra/MongoDB, etc
  * High in accessibility and ease of programmability
  * Lots of open-source
