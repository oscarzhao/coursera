# Key-Value Stores, Time and Ordering

## Introduction

1. Lesson 1: This module motivates and teaches the design of key-value/NoSQL storage/database systems. We cover the design of two major industry systems: Apache Cassandra and HBase. We also cover the famous CAP theorem.

2. Lesson 2: Distributed systems are asynchronous, which makes clocks at different machines hard to synchronize. This module first covers various clock synchronization algorithms, and then covers ways of tagging events with causal timestamps that avoid synchronizing clocks.

These classical algorithms were invented decades ago, yet are used widely in todayâ€™s cloud systems.

## Learning Objectives

1. Identify why key-value/NoSQL systems are popular.
2. Identify which systems fall where under the CAP theorem.
3. Identify the design of and analyze Apache Cassandra.
4. Identify the design of and analyze Apache HBase.
5. Use and analyze various time synchronization algorithms.
6. Tag any given run of a distributed system with Lamport and/or vector timestamps for ordering events.

## Goals and Objectives

After you actively engage in the learning experiences in this module, you should be able to:

1. Know why key-value/NoSQL are gaining popularity
2. Know the design of Apache Cassandra
3. Know the design of Apache HBase
4. Use various time synchronization algorithms
5. Apply Lamport and vector timestamps to order events in a distributed system
